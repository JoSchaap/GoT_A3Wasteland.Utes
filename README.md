Utes Wasteland (GoT/JoSchaap)
===================

       Just a head's up, this isn't your average wasteland. 

Utes Wasteland is much more PVP oriented and faster-paced due to the sheer size of the island.
Some of the major differences in this mission are:

1) It requres mods, to be more specific:

       Any version of AllinArma or the AllinArma terrain packs to make Utes available.
       HLC Weapons Pack (by Toadie) & the ASDG Rails mod 
       * (or the @WSWeapons package from the a3cdn launcher by Inch/Sa-Matra)
       * This package is also available for download on got2dayz.nl named @WLWeapons
       The RHS Escallation mod package by Redhammer Studios
       * (or the @WSRHS package from the a3cdn launcher by Inch/Sa-Matra)
       * This package is also available for download on got2dayz.nl named @WLRHS

2) It does NOT have some features enabled you probably are used too:

      Only locked basebuilding parts are saved accross restarts, and only for 2 days.
      Player location, status and/or gear is NOT saved, so reconnecting means, a fresh start
      Mortars and other static weapons are not available in the gunstores
      there are NO vehicle stores (complete missions to obtain unique vehicles)
      mission vehicles do NOT save accross restarts
      ATM/Bank system has been disabled alltogether
      Warchests, weaponcrates and spawnbeacons are not saved accross restarts
      * Utes is such a small map, that it wouldn't be fair to new connecting players.

3) there are a few prefab bases available accross the map for your group to take over and secure

      There are 5 prefab bases available accross the island, if you or your group secures one you earn an income
      * but you're also at risk because it is shown on the map if a base has been captured!

4) Some missions are not available or have been changed.

      Since the island is too small for convoy missions, and there are custom weapons, vehicles and gear available, some missions have been disabled, or changed to use those items.


Why are we using the same mod-sets?
===================================

A big part of the wasteland community has come to arma from either dayz, or video's of other wasteland players.
Since most of the are not comming from the ArmA game itself it can be quite the hassle figuring out how to find, download and install the correct mod's.

Servers running different mod-sets will eventually end up dividing the community of players and with that comes frustration.

By simply using the same mod-sets as others I hope to prevent this. No more need to exit your game, readjust your mod's just simply search for the server and join it :)


It is never my intention to copy other servers. Nor is is to steal their idea's or bandwith. 
For this reason I even provide (a renamed version to avoid conflicts) of these modsets on my own website/bandwith. (@WLWeapons and @WLRHS).

Credits for the mods do NOT go to me NOR A3Wasteland/GoT2DayZ. I've Simply just built a mission that uses them.

    If you are in any way conflicted by this, or I forgot to give credit, please contact me!
